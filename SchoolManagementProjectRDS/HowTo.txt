Project Details :- Demostrate how to use AWS Beanstack and AWS RDS services.

		   Here we use prebuilt php codes is named "schoolmanagement". Code is shared in folder


Steps to follow:-

1) Configure AWS Elastic Beanstack - with php component

2) While configuring Beanstack select on your own vpc and subnet, same vpc and subnet need to be used for rds deployment also

3) Deploy rds with mysql as database, create database name "schoolmanagement"

4) Select Security group rds and allow source 0.0.0.0/0

5) Copy rds endpoint ( url and port)

6) Edit file - schoolmanagement\config\Database

modify below lines with new rds end point,db username which you created while creating rds and password -


private $_host = private $_host = "mydboption.c2mizpjpdzyp.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:3306";
private $_username = "admin1";
	private $_password = "root12345";

7) Save configuration file "Database"

8) Zip the folder ( select all file inside the folder and do zip , do not zip folder from outside)

9) Go to Beanstack and upload code



10) Data Base Activity - you need to create some table space on rds for "schoolmanagement" application to work


11) install mysql client on linux ec2 - yum install mqsql

12) connect rds sql server as like - mysql -h mydboption.c2mizpjpdzyp.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u admin1 -p schoolmanagement

13) Verify database and tables creation - mysql> show databases;

14) Verify table spaces is created - mysql> use schoolmanagement;

                                     mysql> show tables;

15) From Beanstack application run add courses and see changes happening in tables- mysql> select * from tbl_course;
